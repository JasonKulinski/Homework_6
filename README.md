# Simple Sorting Algorithms for package experience

## A fully functional package that sorts using bubble, quick, and insertion sort algorithms, and has passed all unit tests

This project was created as a simple python package that allows the creators to gain familiarity with git and github, along with other stylistic components. The project also focuses on unit testing, and the correct utilization of the pytest library. The code base is a total of one file, that contains three functions, bubble, quick, and insertion:

- bubble: Is a simple function that takes in an int list and outputs the sorted version of that list

- quick: : Is a simple function that takes in an int list and outputs the sorted version of that list

- insertion: Is a simple function that takes in an int list and outputs the sorted version of that list

All methods include three unit tests outlined in the test_basic_sort.py file
